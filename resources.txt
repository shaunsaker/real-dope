CURRENT TODO:

Couldn't sell one drug
Sell Max didn't update drugs available quantity
Buying more drugs than are available
Selling more drugs than I can - nothing happens
Reloading on deal page
Health buttons weren't working
Health let me eventually buy when I didn't have the cash
Clothing buy isn't working
Weapon buy isn't working (saw ammo flicker)
Deal page space needs centering
uncaught at loadGame TypeError: Cannot read property 'currentGame' of null
*A Login let me go through to home with short password
Signup and login need h3s to display clearly
*B Non existent user was already signed up? - Possible localStorage issue (didn't occur with different user)
Need 'Game saved' display
Firebase UserAuth and database don't match - rel to *A and *B
Signout didn't display loader
Splash logo anim buggy
Page Transitions
Button pushing => heights changing - quite irritating
When saved, didn't save currentDrugs - try reproduce

FUTURE TODO:

If more than 3 drugs available, let user know that they can scroll
