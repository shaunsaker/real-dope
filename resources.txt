Deal page space needs centering
uncaught at loadGame TypeError: Cannot read property 'currentGame' of null
*A Login let me go through to home with short password
Signup and login need h3s to display clearly

Need 'Game saved' display
Firebase UserAuth and database don't match - rel to *A and *B
Signout didn't display loader
Splash logo anim buggy
Page Transitions
